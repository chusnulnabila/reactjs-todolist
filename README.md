# 📚 About This Project
This repository contains my very first React.js project, created as part of my learning journey into web development. I followed a tutorial from YouTube, which you can find here:
📺 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82PXenL4MGg
I am currently in the process of improving my skills and gaining hands-on experience with React.js and modern web technologies. While this project is simple, it represents an important step in my growth as a developer.
I hope this repository showcases my enthusiasm for learning and my dedication to becoming better every day. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome! 😊

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
